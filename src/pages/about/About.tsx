          <h2>HISTORY</h2>
          <p className="paragraph-1">
            Twin Galaxies began in 1981, when Walter Day realized that arcade
            games were becoming huge, but no one really knew who the top players
            were. So he set out to create an official scoreboard that would
            track the best high scores from all over the United States. Think of
            it as the “record book” of the arcade world.
          </p>

          <p className="paragraph-1">
            Day traveled from arcade to arcade collecting scores, talking to
            players, and organizing competitions. Thanks to his work, Twin
            Galaxies quickly became the main authority for video-game records.
            If you wanted your score to be taken seriously, you sent it to Twin
            Galaxies.
          </p>

          <p className="paragraph-1">
            The organization gained even more attention in the 2000s with
            documentaries like The King of Kong, which showed the intense
            rivalries and passion behind classNameic arcade gaming. Over time,
            Twin Galaxies modernized its systems, changed owners, and improved
            how scores are verified, but its mission stayed the same.
          </p>

          <p className="paragraph-1">
            Today, Twin Galaxies is still known as one of the most important
            places for tracking world records in gaming, from old-school arcade
            classNameics to modern speedruns. It’s basically the place where
            gaming history gets written — one high score at a time.
